# RISC-V Cross-compilation examples


This repo contains examples on cross-compilation using different build systems such as Autotools, CMake, Meson and others.

## Requirements

All guides were written using Debian Sid and provide commands for Debian-like distros.

You will need a RISC-V toolchain, I prefer to use one from the Debian repos.
Also a set of standard `build-essential` packages may be useful.
Everything can be installed by running the following command:

```console
# apt install build-essential g++-riscv64-linux-gnu
```

## Sysroot generation

Many projects require external dependencies.
They can be provided using sysroot that can be generated using tools like `debootstrap`, `dnf` or `yocto`.
For simplicity in these guides `debootstrap` will be used.

In order to create sysroot of foreign architecture some sort of emulation is required.
Debian Wiki suggests using QEMU with binfmt for `debootstrap`.
They can be installed running:
```console
# apt install debootstrap qemu-user-static binfmt-misc
```

Sysroot can be generated by running:
```console
# debootstrap --arch=riscv64 --include=<comma separated list of packages> unstable <path> http://ftp.debian.org/debian
```
